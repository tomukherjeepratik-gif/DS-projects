This repository contains a couple of data science projects I built to get hands-on experience with machine learning using Python and scikit-learn. Instead of just reading theory, I wanted to actually build things and see how models behave with real data.

One of the projects focuses on predicting student exam performance based on different factors. I worked on cleaning the data, splitting it into training and testing sets, and applying feature scaling where needed. I trained both Linear Regression and Random Forest models to see how a simple model compares to a more advanced one. I evaluated them using R², MAE, and RMSE to understand how accurate they were and how much error they produced.

The second project is a basic movie recommendation system. The goal was to understand how recommendation systems suggest content by finding patterns and similarities in data. It helped me explore how user preferences can be analyzed and translated into recommendations.

Overall, these projects helped me better understand data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and how machine learning can be applied to practical problems.
